We all know Type 1 Fun. It’s immediate, it’s enjoyable, and it usually involves a comfortable couch or a perfectly executed high-five. Then there’s Type 3 Fun, which is only fun in retrospect, usually after you’ve had a shower, a hot meal, and at least 24 hours to forget the worst parts. But for a select few, there’s Type 2 Fun. The kind that’s miserable while it’s happening, but inexplicably, gloriously, fun to talk about later. And if you’re reading this, chances are you’re not just acquainted with Type 2 Fun – you’re practically married to it. Here are 10 signs you’re hopelessly addicted:

1.  **Your definition of a "good time" involves a map and a complete lack of cell service.** Bonus points if the map is laminated because you anticipate significant water exposure.

2.  **You own more blister plasters than dress socks.** And you're genuinely excited to try a new brand of athletic tape.

3.  **When someone asks about your weekend, your answer starts with "It was brutal..." and ends with a wistful smile.** The more suffering, the better the story.

4.  **You willingly pay money to run through mud, up mountains, or in sub-freezing temperatures.** And you consider it a bargain.

5.  **You view rain, snow, or hail not as inclement weather, but as "character-building opportunities."** Your gear closet is a testament to this philosophy.

6.  **Your idea of a relaxing evening involves meticulously packing a backpack for a trip you know will test your limits.** The weight of anticipation is almost as heavy as the pack itself.

7.  **You’ve ever uttered the phrase, "It'll be fun!" while looking directly at a sheer rock face or a 10-mile uphill slog.** And you genuinely believed it, at least for a moment.

8.  **The thought of a warm bed and a hot meal is the only thing that keeps you going during a particularly grueling stretch.** The reward system is highly effective.

9.  **You secretly (or not so secretly) judge people who prefer Type 1 Fun exclusively.** "They just don't *get* it," you think, while shivering in a bivvy bag.

10. **You’re already planning your next miserable adventure before the current one is even over.** The cycle is endless, and you wouldn't have it any other way.

If you nodded along to more than three of these, congratulations. You're one of us. You understand that the best stories, the deepest friendships, and the most profound sense of accomplishment come not from ease, but from overcoming. It’s in those moments of voluntary discomfort that we truly find out what we’re made of, and then we go home and tell everyone about it.

Embrace the suffering, for it builds character. And if you’re looking for more tales of Type 2 Fun and the gear that (sometimes) helps us endure it, subscribe to my Substack. We're all in this glorious, miserable journey together.
