    <div class="space-y-6 text-charcoal/90 leading-relaxed">
      <p>Growth is not accidental. It is earned through discomfort, repetition, resistance, and time.</p>

      <p>Character is formed in the space between now and later, between effort and reflection, between fatigue and pride. The work may not feel good in the moment. That is the point.</p>

      <p>We design for those who understand Type II experiences: difficult while happening, meaningful in hindsight. We value discipline over drama, resilience over noise, substance over spectacle.</p>

      <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold mt-12">What This Is</h2>
      <p>Builds Character is not about suffering for show. It is about deliberate hardship that compounds.</p>
      <p>The present may resist you. Your future self will thank you.</p>

      <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold mt-12">What This Is Not</h2>
      <p>This is not a motivational brand. It is a composure brand.</p>
      <p>We are not interested in comfort culture, instant gratification, or performative grit. If difficulty is only valuable when someone is watching, it was never about the difficulty.</p>

      <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold mt-12">The Long View</h2>
      <p>This foundation was built for anywhere delayed gratification matters: training, parenting, entrepreneurship, creative work, health, recovery.</p>
      <p>It is not about mileage. It is about time.</p>
      <p>And time is the ultimate endurance event.</p>
